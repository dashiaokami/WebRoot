            <p> <a href="http://w3schools.com">W3Schools</a><br>
            W3 Schools is an online learning tool used to teach people about coding. It was originally developed in 1998,
            and got it's name from WWW (world wide web). It teaches plenty of languages like HTML, CSS, Javascript, and has
            hundreds of lessons. One reason why this tool is super useful is because it's free, and easy to understand as it
            comes with examples in each lesson that allows you to actually practice the code instead of just reading it. I 
            think it's mostly helpful not just for beginners, but even experienced programmers who may forget a thikng or two.
            This is one of my go to websites whenever I'm stuck, or want more info on a specific subject. I'm sure I'll continue
            to use it throughout my career.<br>

            <p> <a href="http://replit.com">Replit</a><br>
            Replit, (previously known as repl.it) is an online code editor that allows you to build apps and websites. It was
            founded in 2016, so it's still fairly new! It's very useful because it supports up to 50 languages, allows live chat
            with teammates for better collaboration, is integrated with GitHub for easy import, and many more cool features. My
            first time using Replit was in a college course, so this is also a nice website for beginners and experienced
            programmers. I don't think I would use Replit a lot, because I have other favorite editors, but I do go back and look
            at previous projects I had for some ideas for the furture.<br>

            <p> <a href="https://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a><br>
            jQuery Mobile is based off of HTML-5, and is an UI system that's designed to make mobile websites and apps. It was first
            released in 2010, and uses HTML-5 and CSS to work across different platforms and devices. This is another tool i used for 
            the first time in one of my college courses. To be honest, it was difficult for me to understand how to properly use i, so
            I struggled a bit. It also seems to be quite out of date as it was last updated in 2017. I think back then, it was probably
            easier to use and more popular for developers. It was probably more used to develop older apps and websites that were widely
            used by people, but then slowly died out. I'm glad I got a chance to play around with it for a class project, but it's
            not something I see myself using in the futre. text info of what the resource contains, why its important or valuable,
        to who it's valuable, and how you'll use it during career<br>

            <p> <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a><br>
            Bootstrap is an open CSS framework that is used to create websites and web apps. It was first created in 2011, and was
            originally named "Twitter Blueprint". It has plenty of different design templates for UI components such as headers, 
            footers, buttons, navbars and more. Bootstrap is pretty important because it provides so many different components, and 
            can also save a lot of time on creating CSS. Bootstrap seems to be pretty popular, so it would make sense for even advanced 
            developers to use it. I do think it's a pretty good start for newer developers though, because of the different themes and 
            templates it has. This is my first time using Bootstrap, so I'm interested to learn about all the different things it can do.
            I can definitely see myself using this for a long time.<br>

            <p> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a><br>
            Stack Overflow is a website where developers of all levels can come together to ask and answer questions all about programming.
            You can pretty much find everything here whether you need help or want to help someone else. I think this website is super important
            because sometimes people need an explaination on something from someone who has experience, rather than an article or a youtube video.
            I'm sure developers of all levels come to this website, but sometimes I see really in dept explainations that I don't understand, so
            there might be more people who have a few years of experience that visit this website. I can definitely see myself using this website
            more often as I learn more, and probably end up asking some questions, or answering someone else's questions!<br>
